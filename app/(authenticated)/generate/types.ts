// The AI only ever returns relevance flags + index references (see
// app/(authenticated)/generate/actions.ts's suggestCvContentAction) — it never returns text for
// these fields. The server resolves those flags against the employee's real profile data before
// this shape is ever built, so every `text`/`title`/`brief`/etc. value here is guaranteed to have
// come from the profile, not from the model. `objective` is the sole exception: it's the one
// field the AI is allowed to generate, per the "selector, not creator" rule.
