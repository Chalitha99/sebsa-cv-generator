/**
 * UI-facing employee shape. Deliberately mirrors the original DataContext `Employee` type so the
 * existing pages/JSX don't need restructuring — only their data source changes. `rowId` (the
 * profiles.id uuid) is the sole identifier — used for routing, list keys, and mutations alike.
 * Profiles previously also had a human-readable `employee_code` (e.g. "EMP-00124") used for
 * routing/display, but it was pure redundancy alongside `id` and has been removed (migration
 * 0022_remove_employee_code.sql).
 *
 * Structured CV fields (experience, academic, specialProjects, certifications) are added to
 * support the Gemini parsing pipeline introduced in Phase 5.
